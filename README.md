# AI Skills

A curated collection of reusable agent skills for the `.agents/skills` framework. These focused capabilities — from formatting commit messages to generating Pydantic models — can be invoked on demand by an AI coding assistant inside any workspace.

- **Python** 3.13+
- [**uv**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or pip

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rcbassil/aiSkills.git
cd aiSkills

# Using uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Using pip
pip install .
```

## Running the Application

```bash
# Using uv
uv run main.py

# Using python directly
python main.py
```

Expected output:

```
Hello from aiSkills!
```

## Usage Examples

Skills are activated by communicating your intent to the agent inside your workspace. For example:

```text
"Update the README"            → triggers readme-updater
"Commit these changes"         → triggers git-commit-formatter
"Review my code"               → triggers code-reviewer
"Document project changes"     → triggers changelog-tracker
"Convert this JSON to a model" → triggers json-to-pydantic
"Refactor Terraform code"     → triggers refactor-module
"Search for vulnerabilities"   → triggers vulnerability-scanner
"Troubleshoot Kubernetes"      → triggers kubernetes-troubleshooter
"Create an architecture diagram" → triggers drawio
```
